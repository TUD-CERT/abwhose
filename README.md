# abwhose [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/bradleyjkemp/abwhose.svg)](https://github.com/bradleyjkemp/abwhose/releases/latest)

The simplest way to find the *correct* place to report a domain for abuse.

```bash
$ abwhose phishing-mcphishface.com

Report abuse to domain registrar:
  Email:     abuse@theregistrar.com
Report abuse to host:
  HostPhish: Submit this form - https://wehostphish.biz/dev/null.php
```

Never again send an abuse report via email only to get a response days later saying:
> Sorry, we only take abuse reports through this online form: https://reallyslow.com/new-report

Instead use `abwhose` and always send your abuse reports to the correct place the first time.

### Installation

```bash
brew install bradleyjkemp/formulae/abwhose
